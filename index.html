          <h3>Their Background</h3>
          <p>Filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, met while studying at Emerson
            College in Boston and began collaborating on various projects. Their breakthrough came with their short film
            <q>Interesting Ball</q> (2008), which gained viral attention online. It showcased their quirky humor and
            distinctive visual style, setting the tone for their future work.
          </p>
          <p>Their unique approach to filmmaking has earned them a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim within the
            industry, solidifying their reputation as innovative and boundary-pushing directors.</p>

          <h4>Worthy of Your Time and Dime</h4>
          <p>In the past, spending money to go to the <q>dollar show</q> to see movies that were released much earlier
            in
            the year was worth it. With the obselence of the <q>dollar show</q> plus the rising costs of movie tickets
            and
            refreshments, a small fortune is now required to take the family to see a film at the neigborhood movie
            theater.
            Few movies are worth the expense, but <q>Everything Everywhere All At Once</q> was so non-conventional that
            it
            was widely considered worthy of the splurge. It was a spectacular display of physics, mathematics, and art.
            Sharing about this movie, is me sharing about subjects that interest me.</p>

          <h4>Depiction of a Multiverse</h4>
          <p>Physicists Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have proposed different classification schemes for multiverses and
            universes. Tegmark's four-level classification consists of Level I: an extension of our universe, Level II:
            universes with different physical constants, Level III: many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and
            Level IV: ultimate ensemble. Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses include quilted, inflationary, brane,
            cyclic, landscape, quantum, holographic, simulated, and ultimate. The ideas explore various dimensions of
            space,
            physical laws, and mathematical structures to explain the existence and interactions of multiple universes.
            Some
            other multiverse concepts include twin-world models, cyclic theories, M-theory, and black-hole cosmology.

          <h4>Cosmic Costume Creator</h4>
          <p>Born in 1970 in Los Angeles, Shirley Kurata grew up in the San Gabriel Valley, the youngest of four
            children.
            Her parents owned a laundromat. She is a Japanese-American wardrobe stylist and costume designer based in
            Los
            Angeles, California. In 2023, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, for her work
            on
            the absurdist comedy-drama indie film Everything Everywhere All at Once.</p>
          <p>For <q>Everything Everywhere All at Once</q>, Kurata designed multiple looks for actors including Michelle
            Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan,Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis, as their characters traveled from the <q>main</q>
            universe to other parts of the multiverse. For the film, Kurata was tasked with designing an extremely large
            number of costumes on a limited budget. Kurata has said that co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert
            encouraged her to <q>Just go crazy, get creative</q>, and that they aimed to create costumes that viewers
            would
            wear on Halloween.</p>

        </figure>
        <section class="section">
          <h4>Creative Inspirations</h4>
          <p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Kurata <q>subverted and reclaimed Asian-centric tropes</q> in styling
            the
            <q>outrageously outfitted personas</q> of Hsu's character, villain Jobu Tupaki, to whom Kurata has said she
            relates. Jobu Tupaki's many looks in the film include <q>Golfer Jobu</q> who wears a pink argyle vest and
            socks,
            exemplifying <q>the perfect Asian daughter who excels at sports and everything else in her life</q>
            according to
            Kurata. <q>Elvis Jobu</q>, on the other hand, wearing an Elvis costume with pink hair and a cigarette,
            signals
            that she is antagonizing her mother. Another is <q>Goth Jobu</q>, who wears an <q>all-black and a vinyl
              A-line
              miniskirt over a sheer tulle petticoat</q>, which The Hollywood Reporter notes is <q>a twist on anime
              cosplay's Victorian doll-inspired Elegant Gothic Lolita.</q> Yet another look is <q>Jobu K-Pop Star</q>,
            influenced by K-pop and Harajuku street style.

          <h4>Meteoric Impact on the Movie</h4>
          <p>CBS News said the film's <q>gravitas</q> would not have been possible <q>without the creative vision behind
              the
              film's amazing (and often universe-defying) costumes - Shirley Kurata</q>. Insider observed that the
            film's
            costumes were <q>more than just clothes</q>, since they convey <q>different iterations of each character</q>
            and
            <q>[place] the viewer in the numerous multiverses traversed throughout the film.</q> Kurata's mind-bending
            vision for Hsu's costumes sets a new precendence, giving other artists like her the opportunity to "push the
            envelope" even in for movies in mainstream cinema.
